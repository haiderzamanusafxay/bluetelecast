                  Bluetelecast started in 2010 with a small group of people who
                  had big ideas. We wanted to change how things worked online.
                  Now, Bluetelecast is a successful company in the US that helps
                  businesses around the world.

                  and giving advice about technology. Our success comes from
                  always trying to get better and finding the best solutions for
                  our clients. People know us for being creative and excellent
                  at what we do.
